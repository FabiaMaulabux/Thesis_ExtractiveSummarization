Um project kick-off . Um I will li list the agenda for today . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . Um we're here to develop uh a new product . Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . Um we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . The market , we should have a look at the market . Um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions , yes . Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific uh specification of that . Um the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think . Um and the last one is the working design . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . Um as you see now I can give a presentation . Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system . Um you can draw on the board using this pen . So do not m make a new file . Um you can use the eraser to make something go away . It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard . And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . back to our project . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number . Um we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . Um that was your presentation ? Um I'll go back to my own presentation . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ? Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ? Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily um or it should not consume too much um power . See you in thirty minutes . But we all use the same white-board file So we can work together on it while we're or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? You should feed that uh that animal . And for a cell phone ? But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so y you you can Most of them . Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . That's just the basic f technical function . So that was my really my part for uh this session . And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Two more things . You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think . Uh then it's already visible in dark . You have a m uh Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ? I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but well , these are quite the same . I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment . We should discuss that . We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? No , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device . Uh is that uh are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? Um you said something about visibility in the dark . Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . The cost price is very low . So uh technically it will be possible . Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices . Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So we'll probably have to implement that . </td><td>Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud . Is there a schedule for this meeting ? Yes , there is actually . Um I will li list the agenda for today . For this meeting . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . Um we're here to develop uh a new product . this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ? No problem . this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . Um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , Um the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , Um then we have this electronic white-board system . you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh sensors , it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button . you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . But we all use the same white-board file Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . Current colour , you can choose another colour . I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . Uh a wee rabbit . Um Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . It it should be a cat . Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , we uh we will focus this internationally , And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available I have some uh initial ideas about some things One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth . Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . but that's uh something we should discuss but take these things into account when you start the discussion . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things . Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ? Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different devices ? I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . Yes , I think it should be something like that . It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , right ? Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , Yeah , I do I don't know that . We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? don't have the information for it . we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? Or are there any o other controls ? Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that . so you must point everywhere , Maybe not even pointed . So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand . And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um in dark too . Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting . Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ? Uh I think most most things have already been said , But uh lots of devices already use infrared . And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue . like uh control multiple devices . we'll probably have to implement that . Um you said something about visibility in the dark . uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . The uh the the digits in black . Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy well , it can be for design , of course . because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . Yes , but there's a cost limitation too . So that's a big problem , I think . twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . The cost price is very low . The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade . Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week . maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . It's use uh a lot of uh Well does it ? I know it from the cell phone . Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work uh quite okay . But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time . so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . See you in thirty minutes . </td></tr><tr><td>132</td><td>People , welcome back with the second meeting . Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Um the top goal of this m Um we will figure that out . Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um we have forty minutes . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with . Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? So any income is welcome . It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , because that's his his field of expertise . on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . Because we do not implement uh a user history . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . Um well , for we do have to uh decide this this meeting . We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um uh our target audience . Dual channel watch . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . Uh And and do we want um the ten digits ? But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision . But But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ? We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ? Maybe you will get some information on that . Um for now we will have the lunch break . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . Um the Interface Designer , um I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept . User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . I think that's what we decided . We can decide the next meeting . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . And I'm sure the market will um uh uh will change , adapt and um so we will see that . But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . Uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed . The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something . And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ? It's a unique item uh It will be an a unique feature of our remote control . And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . Well , volume and something uh like that . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh The ten digits ? A remote control without the ten digits . The older people only use five of them . So we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . Twelve dollar fifty . The fewer buttons you can use on it . Well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition . Interface industrial . Uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition . Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? Can I get a cup of coffee ? Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . And um basically there it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's cased together , nothing more than that . It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . It's been done many times before , and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . I think our uh users will really uh will really like that . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . And um No , so we we should use something else . We do not control the T_V_ set so well . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , so we should think about It's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , uh we should use something like that . so w we should use have You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated um and it will become more costly also . Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . Well , is it maybe there's another possibility . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . Do do you want a list of functions ? Because I don't think but you should uh shou you should know that . But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons . Well , but how how often do you watch all these channels ? But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function . There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . But maybe can we we can think something smart about it . There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts . Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that these kinds of things . Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So we drop the voice recognition ? Because I'll have some updated info on that uh Adapt . So , the channel switching . Of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million . But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . That they only use ten percent the buttons . And the volume button's only four times . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . Uh mo uh zap buttons most . Volume , they are uh use a lot . Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . So And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . So Well And And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . </td><td>Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , the new project requirements , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , Um the remote control should only be used for television , Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . there's a energy source here . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed . So maybe we should consider that . personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think . The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? Another device is not a solution . and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ , Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds . But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something . I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , But that will be very costly , I think . m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . Yeah . Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ? I I think so , according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might , Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . draw draw it on the board . It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . uh it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . Dual channel watch . I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . And and do we want um the ten digits ? But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough . And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . You c you can d make them very fancy so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . Uh If if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume , So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem . it's very cheap . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts . although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh Profitable . We we yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that these kinds of things . If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition . Um the Interface Designer , um I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept . User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um um yeah , some some fancy lights . So we drop the voice recognition ? We can decide the next meeting . Yep . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated 'cause young people uh like new features . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . </td></tr><tr><td>133</td><td>I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room . People , welcome back . Um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ? Um we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation . Um because I'm taking minutes Um were the important themes enclose . You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover . It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five , I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away , the very You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials . And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control . I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ? And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . On screen display . He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different . So um No , r rubber with colours . But but do we want the curved uh uh design , or I it's too dull . Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you're probably right . I like the scroll wheels uh idea . So um on the energy , well , we decided . The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . User interface um Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow . The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design . And for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . And I'm going uh to plan my holidays . Um Uh you you need to help me . Um The casing is curved , single-curved . Traditional batteries uh and solar . Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Um more f more more decisions we made . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided . Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two . I think rubber is nice . You could place a um uh this this would be the button . What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ? A plastic cover with rubber finishing . But the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber . The side , but do you touch between the the these buttons ? With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow . The yellow uh rubber telephone . It's the it's the rubber uh cover . And it's uh colourful . Um thirty five . And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow . Um Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber . So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it . But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also . the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too . I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute . that's the sample sensor . So So if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it's um well , I believe it's uh Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is . So you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function . But what about um the markets uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? And I would think And they can be implemented with a regular chip ? And the regular chip . And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours . Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? But can there be uh wor can they work together ? Yellow case and grey buttons , I think . I believe the But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button . Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , with and uh No . Voice recognition , of course . What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber . Hello hello Mister P_M_ . Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ? So So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape . Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . The the big remote control , something like that . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source . You really have to imagine like winding up your uh I d It would be very new , but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So , but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries . And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . Maybe when you integrate some functions . There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel . Wi within reach . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved . There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries . It's in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries . And I think it's more robust . It's more uh Uh it's more functional . So it it needs to be rubber . And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . So I think this is the best of two worlds . It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip . It's not very flashy and new . Uh I think our customers will go insane . Uh the n the next phase will be um the um not the what is the next phase f Flores ? They cannot work with double-curved . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ? W start with the casing . So So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar . We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ? uh black and yellow . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . Well uh you can use well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too . So it has th the spongy uh feel also . So maybe they can combine these two . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber . Um what about uh the chips ? We use the regular chip ? The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ . Unless uh things have suddenly change again . Uh Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material . Probably watch too much Sponge Bob . Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something . No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects . But Maybe soft material or something . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like . Uh soft material . Uh the fancy look and feel . Apparently . So it might attract uh the young customers . Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? So you don't touch the icons that much . </td><td>Um first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material . I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something . the corporate colours are grey and yellow . Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge . maybe it rubber or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover . a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um , well , a weird um shape . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow . And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh We have uh a curved one . Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . We can use plastic , uh which is the same for rubber , We can use wood and titanium . we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source . we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round . Yes . That is possible too . Yes . I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ? Yeah , uh that's a possibility , There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um And click it to muten the device . So it might attract uh the young customers . it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now . So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute . and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . It performs the action . d did we already decide on the display ? Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh No . I don't think you need it . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility . but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries . it's maybe a bit too too flashy , So it it needs to be rubber . the younger people liked soft material . But they really need the regular chip , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull . And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . But but do we want the curved uh uh design , So I think this is the best of two worlds . what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all . it depends on your walls actually . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip . And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yes , yes . And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part . Yeah . according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology , Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it , But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours . Yeah . Okay , I I agree . Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow . The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design . And for you , the product evaluation . Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ? The casing is curved , single-curved . Traditional batteries uh and solar . Yeah , with colourful rubber . What about uh the finishing of the case ? Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . uh black and yellow . Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course , It's quite modern actually . I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before . um you must have a red uh on and off button . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess . because they're they're rubber too . Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber . 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button . So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting . What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ? we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I'm I'm not so sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , Um I guess you two have to figure that out . We use the regular chip ? Regular . Uh I think our customers will go insane . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber . </td></tr><tr><td>134</td><td>And and the case is is rubber ? M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? Um The production costs . And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price . Push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . And uh maybe not use the special form . It's not that innovative . We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . Um but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . You like the rubber , uh Roo . Well , with the voice recognition feature and uh No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . Uh two or three ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . Is the device easy to use ? Divided by four is two point five . But I'm filling in a three . Does it will so it will be a two point five . The feel of the remote control is spongy . I'll give it a one . The remote control offers enough features . What what we didn't talk about is um uh I think it has . Bec because you can um we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . I'll give it uh a one . For for the for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . So high quality , low acceptance . The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . Maybe we should have a radar uh function . Twenty five Euros . Um you had an overall rating . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? So we could we we could be we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price . Uh leadership . I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . Uh the one before , the third meeting . Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product . Um you're dismissed . Private room , Roo . This is a new model . That is uh it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices . Plastic or rubber . And a button for disabling the voice recognition . So the button we can use plastic . Um the yellow rubber , I think so . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . So I believe uh we are close uh to two . And the scroll uh wheel . I think I think a three . If you make it a four it will be three in general . A seven , a three No . A four and a three together . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three . Then you would make a four . But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . I'll give a two . Uh twenty five . But even now , if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was were t uh was twenty two ? Four six seven eight . Nine divided by six . It's uh the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen . But y you can if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object . To private rooms ? Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . But other users who are new to this device need something like that . There are plastic or rubber . Uh yellow with uh grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . So it's c way too expensive . Well , b basically it when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . So Type of m maybe another market segment . I think I th I think it would have been I would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . I think it's innovative . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too yes , but I think uh it's a two . What you see here is is the basic part . So in that in that way it is advanced , and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . So After all , I think personally I would give a two . But So , it's two , two and three . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . Uh I I think I think something like that . There are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . Basically it's it's completely programmable . You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . Has uh the signals sent to it . At at least uh forty buttons . You can use your voice to to programme it . M about fifty Euros . And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does . Well , it's it's about one point five . We had we had too little information actually . So And uh um the the the well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow . Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative . We we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad . It it's The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited . I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . It's not quite uh ergonomic . The drawing cap capabilities are very limited . And and uh w you were when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing . Pop uh pop up the champagne . So , are there any more cycles in this process ? But um how much time did we get for this meeting ? A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box . No , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market . So you're actually promoting Bluetooth . Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels . Fancy look and feel . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . Uh this this was a most spongy option . So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat Signal . And no added value . </td><td>Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? A a and the voice recognition as well , And and the case is is rubber ? And the buttons ? Plastic or rubber . Uh yellow with uh grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that . al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and Yes . The production costs . Twenty two . And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , th this design is not um within our price model . So the button we can use plastic . But I'm afraid it's not complete . And uh maybe not use the special form . And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . But it's the board decision . Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic but that's not what uh has been asked . Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . just give it a two . was it innovative ? we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype . I think uh it's a two . Is it easy to use ? so it will be a two point five . Is it easy to find ? we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . but I personally give it a one . The feel of the remote control is spongy . and make this a one point five . The remote control offers enough features . I'll give it uh a one . For for the for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . I I've I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . But whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure . Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced . it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . Um you had an overall rating . Um it's it's about one point five . Something like that . we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . The process was good . But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . And and that was the the big deal . We had we had too little information actually . looking at room for creativity , there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow . in the first meeting we we already were very creative . Uh leadership . Fantastic . I think we're a good team . the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ? but SMARTboard was really bad . Uh . The digital pen was okay , although I would like to see um O_C_R_ . But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . The drawing cap capabilities are very limited . And and uh w you were when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing . we need to redesign uh the product . I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box . it's it's it's another approach , Although I think we yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . Is it ? Is it fancy ? I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh . Um </td></tr><tr><td>135</td><td>This is our first team meeting . I'll be your Project Manager for today , for this project . My name is Mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off . You're our Marketing Expert . So , our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I took this off our corporate website . It's We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . So So we put the fashion in electronics . First step will be the functional design . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen . Well , gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal . I think the creative genius should go first . So , draw us your favourite animal . Draw us a technical animal . Well , our Marketing Expert . Show us an animal . Pick a pick a pick a clean sheet . , I'm supposed to draw the animal next . Think it need shoes . Like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us . another beep to stop the meeting . What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? What The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control . I think we really need to cut the meeting short . What do we This Quick What we're going to Selling price , twenty five Euros . The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately . We'll reach the uh reach that profit . About uh marketing transfer , whatever ? Anyways , the the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything . I'll see you back here in thirty minutes . Nick Broer , User Interface Designer . I'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view . Uh format . Do uh Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in Just for T_V_ remote control . Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add , and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . My name is Xavier Juergens , I'm the Industrial Designer , and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today . My drawing skills are really bad , so . They are really bad , my drawing skills . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . And I think uh those things we can use . is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . Um I will be uh Pr Project the Marketing Expert . And I will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project product . Experience with the tiger . Selling price . </td><td>I'll be your Project Manager for today , for this project . My name is Mark Um my name is Dirk , Dirk Meinfeld . Um I will be uh Pr Project the Marketing Expert . Nick Broer , User Interface Designer . My name is Xavier Juergens , I'm the Industrial Designer , we need design a remote control for television set , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . First step will be the functional design . so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . So , draw us your favourite animal . It's supposed to be a dolphin , I like the elephant . the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger . I introduce to the world the amazing ant . What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control . I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it revolutionary changes , so very intuitive design , I guess . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ? but I think it's a little take it into consideration . is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . Selling price , twenty five Euros . The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately . We'll reach the uh reach that profit . international . Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . </td></tr><tr><td>136</td><td>Today , functional design phase . I will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . Anyways , um today three presentations , from every one of you . And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so . Who would like wanna go first ? Uh it's still a bit open . If I can cut in , is it people or men ? We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . So I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . Um we're targeting young people now , because our um This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , which are um the younger people were defined under forty . They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . Or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design . And sell the covers separately , for example . We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately . So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . So just I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . Would you like to share ? I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , like you said . I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . For example , a little T_V_ guide . Like you have a little just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . I think it's easy to implement , we should go for that . Uh speech recognition . A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay . I think we should go for universal , because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . I think universal remote control should be possible . Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries . So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it's very hard to do . It's not a mature technology , I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , so I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . Everything we target is under forty , so . So it's a good and a bad idea . So I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . A double-sided remote control ? For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a Sony that won't for a Philips T_V_ . I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones , the big brands , so . Uh I think just a b and the navigation is very basic , it's usually the same thing . I think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , I think it's possible , just the way how to . I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . Let's see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here . And flash takes up a lot of batteries again . So power button on top . Um Mute . Do we hardly I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . You have just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's it's it's very annoying . I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . It could be very flat , could be very small . And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole for example um you just put it down , it recharges for example . I don't think it's very expensive . Do they want but they want a rechargeable one ? I'm not sure , you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important . So um let's go through the Covers is covers is good . So what we have is you have I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost . People change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . Everything is you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu . Younger , age sixteen and forty five . Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes . I think it's something we should put into consideration . Apparently it's what people want , so . We should see if what it costs , if it's possible . I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily . We could let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . It's not that uh it's not the most important function , it's just an extra thing , it just you press the buttons on top , because your finger is on top . How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ? Uh this looks a little About the L_C_D_s thing . Well if it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , because it's it's cool . Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . I think this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons for example . For up and down , ma make it a circle on it , because it I think the channel button should be in the centre . Channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely . So either We either we have to decide what what people want . Either this one , this this could be the luxurious one . So we have channel buttons here . I'm just drawing something uh . Uh I think this would this would look cool . You could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here . Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . But let's cut the meeting for now yes . Which channel selection ? 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too . Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . Uh let's just start with the method . So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . Gets the remote control . Where is the remote control ? That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , a really good idea . I come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear . Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . Um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . Uh This I pretty much covered . So what we want to go to is not this one , but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons . This is not the final design , this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea . And it costs too much to fabricate , so we're on a tight budget here . And it's Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the C that's a problem with the with the text then . I it's basically an idea to overcome these issues , because No , but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used . I heard a beep go . So the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ? Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up . So we have the basic channels we've got here , uh the power button somewhere over here ? Is that used often ? The mute button ? Do people use that often ? But isn't that expensive in the entire package ? 'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station And do people actually want that ? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ? Because we decided that it's n not that important . Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , I can draw out some ideas . Well , we have decided more or less the basic structure . Maybe another idea uh . To make it kind of futuristic . So basically can I what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ? Yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it's basically the most important function . Which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that's why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper . You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . Uh a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning . That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . No , I think this is a good idea . If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf . Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? So then you can choose , you have every decision . So but But I think that will cost a lot . You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , you don't need basic station . I'm going to try to find that out . I like the covers . I would like to make a decision . Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ? Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? If you rule out functions , then uh and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it . Those two things . Do they realise how much that costs ? Even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price . Uh I But I really need finance information . If we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , because I have to put all the electronics in it . M I personally would prefer it on the top . We should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information . Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space . If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . Like a process uh . Uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use . Um new preferences preferences . Uh um um beep to find your control , was that was in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . It's a little bit uh I lost it , the computer uh crashed , so . Nokia w Uh . And uh with different colours uh . Or or with the volume selection . Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection . I don't know where exactly , but Wha No . Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Different colours maybe . If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top . So you can use it maximum , because uh it's a lot it costs a lot . It's expensive to build it , so you must use the maximum of it . I think it's L_C_D_ is better now . </td><td>Today , functional design phase . The functional requirements , it's uh uh very important for uh the user , seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . Um they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , and um they use yeah , they use zap a lot , but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings we can we can hide those under a menu or something , that was in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel . 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too . Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . Yeah . some technical functions . There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons . Yeah , it's true . So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . You have the the power coming in , The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . You have infrared Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light . Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore I don't think we should remove the button , But I don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example . This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , um the younger people were defined under forty . And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow , With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your I think this is a good idea . I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , Y Yes , I think so too . I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , For example , a little T_V_ guide . I'm not sure it's even possible , I have to check that out , I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T_V_ we should go for that . then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal , Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries . Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet . you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . maybe a little harder plastic If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves it's not even a bad idea . For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , something I have to look into . you have to come up with a components concept , you should do some trend-watching , I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , because we're working with different types of television , That is true . I don't think so . A double-sided remote control ? I don't think that's useful . but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones , the big brands , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . I think it's possible , I thi I think so too . Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever . And uh with different colours uh . I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have . we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume Think it's like this . I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . Yeah , in the middle . Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf . but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash . We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up . We could do that . uh the power button somewhere over here ? I usually press it on top . Mute . I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection . Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . But I think that will cost a lot . Uh a normal wire would be better . I'm not sure if it costs a lot , And do people actually want that ? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ? we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station . I think this is a brilliant product . because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , Could you post some other essentials of what people want , Where would we want the uh teletext button ? Do we put it somewhere over here ? Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , we don't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . but that's what we stick under the menu button . Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . If it isn't , then we cannot reach it . But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu . Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . Different colours maybe . And the design , it should differ . let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . Let's take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with . If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top . How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ? But nee the function of it . So we have three people saying it should be on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , In the middle . Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . I think the channel button should be in the centre . but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . But it has to be a little bit heavier . Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . Yeah , let's think of a name , okay . the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , If you rule out functions , then uh and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . I I'm not sure . </td></tr><tr><td>137</td><td>Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features . Um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black . We agreed that we would implement both the L_C_D_ and speech recognition , but I'll get to that in a moment . 'Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway . So so , like I said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , but we have 'em now , and it's bad . Prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype . It's it's part of the rubber , I suppose . Finances , that's what we have here , what you drew . We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . So just half a Euro for You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . Well think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side . There are ninety one percent of uh the people , or something like that . But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it , we'll just then we'll do it in black . We'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . It it's not uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , so . I think you that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together . Just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we agreed before . Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . But we need that for the L_C_D_ display . Then again , we have the L_C_D_ display , which is also expensive . Could we could take out the curve . So you can change any colour you want . So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . So which in in turn Rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break . I al like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour , which would make this black a black and grey . I think those are basic col They want to To ensure the profit . We're just uh we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this . We have a budget of twelve fifty per product . I mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing to have I think they would do . So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . I say lose the curve . No , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . we could make it yellow then , but You second that , you second that we lose the curve . So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has . So I think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . So I think that would still make it a nice product . That's just now just we could just discuss how the project went . Because that was I th it was really essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost . Either two or one maybe . So it could either be a two or a one . I'd use an remote control . I think but we didn't even there was no issue on making a manual actually . Maybe it's a two , because d uh the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button . You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . No , y I mean in the L_C_D_ screen , the small screen . they didn't really define in what should be used for . But the But I think in for example like T_V_ guides , I think that's that th that you can transmit through it and everything . Just for extra information on your programmes . uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . No , maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly . I think we d should just lower this . Maybe maybe it's a three though . We could've used it more effectively probably . We could have ev even lost the selection button and uh done everything via L_C_D_ selection . Can you talk to remote control ? It does it's not part of the basic product . The the sh the the functions are trendy . It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . It's possible , but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour . One two three . Two two point some two point something . Two and two thirds . So like I said , changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything . I think we div I think we did very well , uh ev even if you look at this score , we did quite well . It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved . So that's the final product without the speakers , I guess . General project , what's i in For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , which I thought was pretty creative , because it was never never ever listed somewhere . I mean perhaps I screwed up because I d put a put a speech recognition into it . I think we did pretty well as team-work though . It didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever . There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them . It's a little less it the response time is le it's very bad . It's good to visualise everything , but I think the response time should could be a lot better . I just you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever . I didn't have any uh more information , it's just always the same here . So I'd I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually . So Any new ideas found ? I'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps . Step into the future of of remote controlling your T_V_ . No that's a that's a catchy slogan . Control your remote control . I go for future R_C_ probably . Uh that that's That makes me think of different products than a remote control really . It should be it should be longer , because it's not a product name that you f print on a box . Triple dash R_ dash s s C_ . Triple R_ or triple R_C_ ? Uh I think that the the R_C_ together takes away the the the image of it's a triple Uh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control , but it's only a single remote control . I think triple R_ is cool . And it looks cool when you print it in font , looks pretty cool . We have the product , we have the costs , we have the possibility of everything . Uh s Final design . Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here . We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad . If you put them all black , it's not really that good a contrast . So that's basically what we chose there . Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample , which you can't do with a normal remote control , which people already do . So Well , I'd I tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control So black and grey is okay . No , we basically We need to stick to that . No , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . Which are basically accessible through the menu button . And it's pretty straight-forward , you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus . So One I d no , actu No , it it is pretty straight-forward . Ten , sixteen , divided by Is two two third . We come out on a average of two one eighth . And we could share information which we received . There was a little delay in the bit of a c crucial delay . Maybe there's something on the website which will help us out . Is that a name or a c campaign ? Is it triple R_C_s ? That's uh the integration story again . Or say let's lose rubber , take plastic . Although we are demolishing a little bit the style . We take plastic for the basic cover and We can put those to the to the other covers . Because we have to lose two things and I guess . Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , because in the beginning I had no list of available materials , and then I d had not list of available c finances . I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , but then again , it's for young people . I think it won't be a big problem . Um With the more important functions on . But M Changing covers is also trend that we followed . But I think for this price , this is it's really a reasonable product . But if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it's cannot be done for this . But there's uh also one problem with this I noticed . You have to finish it completely , then download it , it's then start a new one . Uh at least it's not something with numbers . I would lose the C_ and just name it triple R_ . The first sheet . For the advanced uh settings . What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? Just uh only the channels and or What uh ? Not with the speech recognition . But the colours , we don't have special colours on it . It's um ten , sixteen three uh two two point seven or something like that . With an L_C_D_ screen . Banana recei R_C_ . Triple R_ dash . Merge . Ma it's maybe it's not on the network of uh the rest . Can I see scores ? </td><td>Detailed design Prototype presentation , well first It's basically what we agreed upon , but just a little bit more specified . Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow And it I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber So we have it's a bit round shaped , We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway . we have sin one curve , a design . Rubber design . And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample , Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side . so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , we could take out the curve . I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers . Can we then not also uh change the material ? We take plastic for the basic cover something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the We can put those to the to the other covers . Rubber would increase durability so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ? and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company But we can take a risk . that's not our decision to take . I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . but the one that g has given us the order to design this . and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an still an option , but not for this price . yeah , it's true . So that's what we gotta go with . just to get it through final , I say lose the curve . Oh that's true , Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . I second that . So we keep the curve . And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , we're final on that . because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has . we could just discuss how the project went . I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , because it's good . I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price , let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false So so the buttons , the look and feel . One and a half . And the next one uh yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it . so I think it that's that deserves a one . Definitely . And the next one . Manual . I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , it it is pretty straight-forward . What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu , I thought that people wanted previews on their I don't think it's possible really . uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . A three . I mean the shape is trendy . The the sh the the functions are trendy . It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . Maybe we should go with a two then , Overall score . Two and two thirds . mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . 'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven , I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display . We could have used it more efficiently , like I said , changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything . For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . I think we did pretty well as team-work though . Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool . I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them . Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that . The one thing we missed though , we don't have a product name . And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important . The Real Reaction Remote . Triple R_ it is . have to write my report now , I guess . Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ? Yeah , sure . What do we scrap . Yeah . I would say I would agree with you on the colour , So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess . You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible . </td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":["save(log = log, runname = \"automated CNN Meta generation\", modelname = \"CNN Meta model\", model = model, rouge_array = rouge_array, baseline = False)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":21}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"version":"3.7.0","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"name":"Main","notebookId":2828187062111397,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"colab":{"name":"Main.ipynb","version":"0.3.2","provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":["5n32-aG5_AWA","V0keNvZJcJ26","pl7EQevscTvi","DR8aD2azcZf5","k98riy8cZyan","93MMXX4VHMxr","hW74QNVQHXIq","l3ia6QsvpEHW","VA5_a6-dnc_i","sh5HWP7PckhX","tg1PtUs0aR6s"]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
